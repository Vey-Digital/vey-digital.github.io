Legal/Policy (quick checklist)

You hosting your own original AI works: simplest path. (Avoid third-party copyrighted stems.)
Post clear Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and DMCA process (takedown email, repeat-infringer clause).
If you later host third-party music (covers, user uploads), you‚Äôll need to address:
Mechanical licenses for compositions
Public performance reporting to PROs (ASCAP/BMI/SESAC) and SoundExchange (for digital performance of sound recordings)
Add a ‚ÄúNo copyrighted inputs without license‚Äù rule for AI training/derivations.
(This is product guidance, not legal advice.)
