AI only helps if it improves a number you care about. This plan shows how to ship **one useful win in a week**, using the tools you already have. It’s the approach we use at **VeyDigital**: keep scope tight, make decisions with data, and standardize what works.

## The outcome we’re aiming for
**Deliver a weekly KPI brief** (or a small automation) that:
- highlights what changed and why,
- recommends **one action**,
- links back to the source data for trust.

Pick **one success metric** before you start:
- Time saved per week (minutes),
- Faster detection of issues (latency),
- A specific rate moving in the right direction (e.g., conversion, reply time).

---

## Day 0 — Baseline (30 minutes)
Write down today’s effort:
- How long does the current report/task take end-to-end?
- Where does quality drop (missing context, late delivery)?
- What would make a “good enough” version?

You can’t claim lift without a baseline.

---

## Day 1 — Scope to the minimum viable data
Connect only what supports the outcome (not everything in the warehouse):
- Core KPIs (daily): sessions, conversions, revenue or leads
- One driver view: channel/creative or landing page
- One behavior view: funnel step or cohort slice
- Clear metric definitions (keep a one-paragraph glossary)

If it doesn’t help the recommendation, it’s out of scope for v1.

---

## Day 2 — Draft the format (before automating)
Create the **brief template** you want the agent to follow:

**KPI Snapshot (7 days vs prior):**  
- Top deltas (↑/↓) with likely drivers  
- One risk or anomaly to watch

**Recommendation:**  
- One action, with owner and due date

**Links:**  
- Dashboard or table for verification

This becomes your quality bar.

---

## Day 3 — First pass with an agent (human in the loop)
Generate a draft using the scoped data. Reviewer checks:
- Are the deltas correct?
- Are drivers supported by the data shown?
- Is the recommendation concrete and feasible this week?

Approve, edit, or send back. Keep notes on what needed fixing.

---

## Day 4 — Guardrails and logging
- **Access:** read-only wherever possible  
- **Logging:** timestamp, inputs, output summary  
- **Failure modes:** what happens if data is late or incomplete  
- **Distribution:** Slack/email with a clear subject line and owner

---

## Day 5 — Measure observed impact
Track **before vs after**:
- Minutes saved (report prep, handoffs)
- Detection latency (how quickly you catch dips)
- Recommendation adoption (% of weeks with an owner + due date)

If you didn’t move the metric, simplify. Tight scope beats clever prompts.

---

## Day 6 — Standardize
If results are good:
- Schedule delivery (day/time),
- Store the template and glossary,
- Document the owner and escalation path,
- Add a simple checklist for weekly review.

---

## Day 7 — Decide what’s next
Choose exactly **one** expansion:
- Add a second slice (device or geography),
- Add a short “what changed” alert midweek,
- Automate one handoff (e.g., create a task with the recommended action).

Each addition should have its **own** metric and owner.

---

## Common traps to avoid
- **Scope creep.** If everything is “phase one,” nothing ships.  
- **Unverifiable claims.** Always link back to the source view.  
- **No owner.** Recommendations without a name and date don’t move.  
- **Too many tools.** Prove value first; tool shopping can wait.

---

## How VeyDigital helps (low friction)
- **Quick Insights Dashboard (pilot):** an agent-assisted weekly KPI brief with one recommended action, delivered where your team already works.  
- **Ops Automation Setup:** small, safe automations that qualify leads, draft replies, and file tasks—with approvals and logs.  
- **Enablement:** short how-to videos and one-pagers so the process sticks.

If you want a quick scoping chat, use the links in the footer. We’ll identify **one outcome**, estimate potential time saved, and give you a step-by-step plan to get it live next week—using your current stack.
