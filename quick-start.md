## Getting Started
Your site is using the **Minimal Mistakes** theme with a splash homepage and top navigation.

## 1) Add pages
Create pages the same way as this one. Use `layout: single` and give each a `permalink`.

## 2) Add posts (optional)
Create files in `_posts/` named like `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.  
They will appear under **/blog/** if you have a blog index page.

## 3) Customize styles (optional)
Edit `_sass/custom/_custom.scss` to adjust colors, buttons, spacing, etc.

## 4) Images
Place images in `assets/images/` and reference them with full paths (e.g. `/assets/images/hero.jpg`).

## 5) Search and navigation
Your top navigation comes from `_data/navigation.yml`.  
Search is enabled and appears in the masthead.
