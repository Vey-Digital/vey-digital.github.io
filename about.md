## Agentic AI Framework

Our AI solutions follow an agentic architecture that enables them to act autonomously within defined business goals. Each agent can retrieve data, detect changes, generate summaries, and deliver updates, turning dashboards into proactive tools that support decision making. 


### Capabilities

• Goal-based alerts and threshold tracking  
• Contextual data querying and interpretation  
• Secure, logged interactions with full human oversight  

### Infrastructure and Deployment
• Deployable across AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or Vercel  
• Uses MLOps for automated testing, version control, and monitoring  
• Supports Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for context aware accuracy  
• Built for scalability, observability, and governance  

This framework allows VeyDigital to deliver customized AI agents that align with each client’s environment, secure, compliant, and optimized for longterm performance.
