## Agentic AI Framework

VeyDigital’s AI agents are designed using **agentic principles**—enabling systems to act on defined goals, monitor data automatically, and complete multi-step workflows without manual prompts.  
Each agent combines structured analytics with contextual reasoning, allowing organizations to move from passive dashboards to active, insight-driven operations.

### Core Capabilities
- **Automated Insight Generation:** Agents analyze key metrics, detect changes, and summarize outcomes on a defined schedule.  
- **Proactive Monitoring:** Goal-based triggers notify users when KPIs move beyond target thresholds.  
- **Decision Support:** Agents recommend next actions based on data patterns and established rules.  
- **Human Oversight:** All outputs remain reviewable and logged for transparency and accountability.  

### Deployment & Architecture

Our agentic framework supports cloud-agnostic deployment to meet client infrastructure and compliance requirements.

**Supported Platforms**
- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)** – for scalable AI and data hosting using Bedrock and SageMaker.  
- **GCP (Google Cloud Platform)** – for integration with BigQuery, Vertex AI, and managed Looker datasets.  
- **Azure** – for enterprise clients leveraging Power Platform or Azure Machine Learning.  
- **Vercel / Supabase** – for lightweight, secure web deployment and edge delivery of interactive dashboards.

**AI & MLOps Stack**
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** – for context-aware data queries.  
- **MCP (Model Control Protocol)** – to manage model versioning, input validation, and observability.  
- **MLOps Pipelines** – to automate model updates, testing, and performance monitoring across environments.  
- **Scalability & Observability:** Central logging, tracing, and cost monitoring ensure stable, compliant operations.

### Key Benefits
- Cloud flexibility — deploy where the client’s data already resides.  
- High performance — elastic scaling for queries, AI inference, and reporting.  
- Governance ready — audit trails, version control, and read-only data policies.  
- Cost control — efficient architectures with serverless or pay-per-use options.

In summary, VeyDigital’s agentic AI framework combines automation, data governance, and scalable infrastructure to deliver intelligent, dependable analytics for modern organizations.
